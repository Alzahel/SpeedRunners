# SpeedRunners

Speerunners is a game made by four 1st year students under my direction. The goal of the project was to allow these 4 beginners students who mostly never had coded before (nor used Unity) to discover how a game is made.
With this idea in mind, i tried to direct them the best i could but i didn't take too much part in the production process.
Thanks to this methodology they were able to acquire a good amount of knowledge by resolving issues by themselves and by learning from their mistakes.

The result is this game, which is of course still bugged and incomplete, but it's also a good playable prototype that they can be proud of.

The game core mechanics take inspiration from the original SpeedRunners game :
1) The players are evolving in a closed circuit
2) The camera is common to all players and will follow the 1st player.
3) If you fall behind and get off the screen, you die.
4) The last one standing wins the game.

 The Game includes :
 
##titreSlides & Wall slides
 
 
 ##Wall Climb & Wall jumps
 
 ##Items
 
 ##Obstacles with checkpoints
