# SpeedRunners

Speerunners is a project made by four 1st year students under my direction.

The game core mechanics take inspiration from the original SpeeRunners game :
1) The players are evolving in a closed circuit
2) The camera is common to all players and will follow the 1st player.
3) If you fall behind and get off the screen, you die.
4) The last one standing wins the game.
